#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about a digital media store that includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry asc;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, Inv.InvoiceId

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009? 
SELECT COUNT(*)

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) AS 'Total Sales', e.LastName, e.FirstName
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = "Sales Support Agent"
GROUP BY e.LastName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) as 'Total Sales', emp.LastName, emp.FirstName
FROM chinook.invoices inv

ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) desc
LIMIT 1;

#15. Group the playlist table in a new way using a case statement.
SELECT Name,
CASE WHEN Name = 'Movies' THEN "Binge Watcher"

#17. Show the customer with the highest invoice total.
SELECT MAX(i.Total) as 'max_total', i.CustomerId, c.FirstName, c.LastName
